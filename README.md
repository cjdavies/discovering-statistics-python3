Code from Andy Field's book, "Discovering Statistics Using R", translated into Python 3.

I am working my way through Professor Andy Field's excellent textbook, "Discovering Statistics Using R". Like many people, I took a statistics class in college, but forgot most of it. I decided that I wanted to learn statistics more thoroughly, and chose this book. In addition to learning statistics and gaining some familiarity with the R language, I will convert the R code into Python 3 code, since Python is becoming a very popular language for doing data science. I am not a Python expert, so my code will probably be less than Pythonic, so suggestions for improvement are welcome.
